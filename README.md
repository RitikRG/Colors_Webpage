# Colors_Webpage
This is the first complete webpage that I have made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. I have taken the design of the webpage from Brian Designs. It took 6+ hours of coding to complete this page and I am aware of the fact that something like this can be made in half this time using frameworks and libraries but I just wanted to do it the Vanilla way.
